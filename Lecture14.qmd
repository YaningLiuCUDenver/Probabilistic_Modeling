 We will study a class of models in which customers arrive in some
random manner at a service facility. Upon arrival they are made to wait in queue
until it is their turn to be served. Once served they are generally assumed to leave
the system. For such models we will be interested in determining, among other
things, such quantities as the average number of customers in the system (or in the
queue) and the average time a customer spends in the system (or spends waiting
in the queue).

## Preliminaries

We will derive certain identities which are valid in the great majority of queueing models.

### Cost Equations

Some fundamental quantities of interest for queueing models are

\begin{array}{lll}
L, & \text{the average number of customers in the system}; \\
L_{Q}, & \text{the average number of customers waiting in queue}; \\
W, & \text{the average amount of time a customer spends in the system}; \\
W_Q, & \text{the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in queue}.
\end{array}

A large number of interesting and useful relationships between the preceding and other quantities of interest can be obtained by making use of the following idea: Imagine that entering customers are forced to pay money (according to some rule) to the system. We would then have the following basic cost identity:
$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{average rate at which the system earns} \\
&=\lambda_a\times \text{ average amount an entering customer pays}
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-eq8-1}
where $\lambda_a$ is defined to be average arrival rate of entering customers. That is, if
$N(t)$ denotes the number of customer arrivals by time $t$, then
$$
\lambda_a=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{N(t)}{t}
$$
We now present a heuristic proof of @eq-eq8-1.

**Heuristic Proof of @eq-eq8-1** Let $T$ be a fixed large number. In two different ways, we will compute the average amount of money the system has earned by time $T.$ On one hand, this quantity approximately can be obtained by multiplying the average rate at which the system earns by the length of time $T.$ On the other hand, we can approximately compute it by multiplying the average amount paid by an entering customer by the average number of customers entering by time $T$ (and this latter factor is approximately $\lambda_aT).$ Hence, both sides of @eq-eq8-1 when multiplied by $T$ are approximately equal to the average amount earned by $T.$ The result then follows by letting $T\to\infty.$

By choosing appropriate cost rules, many useful formulas can be obtained as special cases of @eq-eq8-1. For instance, by supposing that each customer pays \$1 per unit time while in the system, @eq-eq8-1 yields the so-called Littleâ€™s formula,
$$
L=\lambda_{a}W
$$ {#eq-eq8-2}
This follows since, under this cost rule, the rate at which the system earns is just the number in the system, and the amount a customer pays is just equal to its time in the system.

Similarly if we suppose that each customer pays \$1 per unit time while in
queue, then @eq-eq8-1 yields
$$
L_Q=\lambda_a W_Q
$$ {#eq-eq8-3}
By supposing the cost rule that each customer pays \$1 per unit time while in
service we obtain from @eq-eq8-1 that the
$$
\text{average number of customers in service } =\lambda_a E[S]
$$ {#eq-eq8-4}
where $E[S]$ is defined as the average amount of time a customer spends in service. 

It should be emphasized that @eq-eq8-1 through @eq-eq8-4 are valid for almost all queueing models regardless of the arrival process, the number of servers, or queue discipline.

### Steady-State Probabilities

Let $X(t)$ denote the number of customers in the system at time $t$ and define
$P_n,n\geqslant0$,by
$$
P_{n}=\lim_{t\to\infty}P\{X(t)=n\}
$$
where we assume the preceding limit exists. In other words, $P_n$ is the limiting or long-run probability that there will be exactly $n$ customers in the system. It is sometimes referred to as the *steady-state probability* of exactly $n$ customers in the system. It also usually turns out that $P_n$ equals the (long-run) proportion of time that the system contains exactly $n$ customers. For example, if $P_0=0.3$, then in the long run, the system will be empty of customers for 30 percent of the time. Similarly, $P_1=0.2$ would imply that for 20 percent of the time the system would contain exactly one customer.

Two other sets of limiting probabilities are $\{a_n,n\geqslant0\}$ and $\{d_n,n\geqslant0\}$, where
$$
\begin{align*}
a_{n} &=\mathrm{proportion~of~customers~that~find~}n\\
&\mathrm{in~the~system~when~they~arrive,~and}\\
d_{n} &=\mathrm{proportion~of~customers~leaving~behind~}n\\
&\mathrm{in~the~system~when~they~depart}
\end{align*}
$$
That is, $P_n$ is the proportion of time during which there are $n$ in the system; $a_n$ is the proportion of arrivals that find $n;$ and $d_n$ is the proportion of departures that leave behind $n.$ That these quantities need not always be equal is illustrated by the following example.

:::{#exm-exa1}
Consider a queueing model in which all customers have service times equal to 1, and where the times between successive customers are always greater than 1 [for instance, the interarrival times could be uniformly distributed over (1,2)]. Hence, as every arrival finds the system empty and every departure leaves it empty, we have
$$a_0=d_0=1$$
However,
$$
P_0\neq1
$$
as the system is not always empty of customers.
:::


It was, however, no accident that $\alpha_n$ equaled $d_n$ in the previous example. That arrivals and departures always see the same number of customers is always true as is shown in the next proposition.

:::{#prp-prp1}
In any system in which customers arrive and depart one at a time
$$
\text{the rate at which arrivals find } n= \text{ the rate at which departures leave }n
$$
and
$$
a_n=d_n
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Proof An arrival will see $n$ in the system whenever the number in the system goes from $n$ to $n+1;$ similarly, a departure will leave behind $n$ whenever the number in the system goes from $n+1$ to $n.$ Now in any interval of time $T$ the number of transitions from $n$ to $n+1$ must equal to within 1 the number from $n+1$ to $n. [$Between any two transitions from $n$ to $n+1$,there must be one from $n+1$ to $n$, and conversely.] Hence, the rate of transitions from $n$ to $n+1$ equals the rate from $n+1$ to $n;$ or, equivalently, the rate at which arrivals find $n$ equals the rate at which departures leave $n.$ Now $a_n$, the proportion of arrivals finding $n$, can be expressed as
$$
a_n=\frac{\text{the rate at which arrivals find } n}{\text{overall arrival rate}}
$$
Similarly,
$$
d_{n}=\frac{\mathrm{the~rate~at~which~departures~leave~}n}{\mathrm{overall~departure~rate}}
$$
Thus, if the overall arrival rate is equal to the overall departure rate, then the preceding shows that $a_n=d_n.$ On the other hand, if the overall arrival rate exceeds the overall departure rate, then the queue size will go to infinity, implying that $a_{n}= d_{n}= 0.$
:::

Hence, on the average, arrivals and departures always see the same number of customers. However, as @exm-exa1 illustrates, they do not, in general, see the time averages. One important exception where they do is in the case of Poisson arrivals.

:::{#prp-prp2}
Poisson arrivals always see time averages. In particular, for Poisson arrivals,
$$P_n=a_n$$
:::

To understand why Poisson arrivals always see time averages, consider an arbitrary Poisson arrival. If we knew that it arrived at time $t$, then the conditional distribution of what it sees upon arrival is the same as the unconditional distribution of the system state at time $t.$ For knowing that an arrival occurs at time $t$ gives us no information about what occurred prior to $t.$ (Since the Poisson process has independent increments, knowing that an event occurred at time $t$ does not affect the distribution of what occurred prior to $t.)$ Hence, an arrival would just see the system according to the limiting probabilities.

Contrast the foregoing with the situation of @exm-exa1 where knowing that an arrival occurred at time $t$ tells us a great deal about the past; in particular it tells us that there have been no arrivals in $(t-1,t).$ Thus, in this case, we cannot conclude that the distribution of what an arrival at time $t$ observes is the same as the distribution of the system state at time $t.$

For a second argument as to why Poisson arrivals see time averages, note that the total time the system is in state $n$ by time $T$ is (roughly) $P_nT.$ Hence, as Poisson arrivals always arrive at rate $\lambda$ no matter what the system state, it follows that the number of arrivals in $[0,T]$ that find the system in state $n$ is (roughly) $\lambda P_nT.$ In the long run, therefore, the rate at which arrivals find the system in state $n$ is $\lambda P_n$ and, as $\lambda$ is the overall arrival rate, it follows that $\lambda P_n/\lambda=P_n$ is the proportion of arrivals that find the system in state $n.$

The result that Poisson arrivals see time averages is called the $PASTA$ principle.
